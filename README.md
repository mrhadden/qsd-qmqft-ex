# QSD Collapse Framework: Causal Structure of Quantum Evolution

This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, and supporting materials for the paper:

**Causal Expansion of Quantum Structure: Coherence Chains, Multipartite Collapse, and Gradient-Limited Emission in QSD**

## ðŸ§  Overview

This work extends the **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)** model to provide a causally structured interpretation of quantum collapse. It introduces the concept of **Collapse Propagation Acceptance (CPA)** as a finite, physically gated interval that follows collapse and precedes re-lock. The model reframes time, motion, and entanglement as outcomes of discrete coherence intervals regulated by substrate pacing.

## ðŸ“œ Key Concepts

- **Causality Intervals (CI):** Bounded regions of substrate-permitted coherent evolution.
- **Collapse Boundary (CB):** Structural endpoint of a CI, where pacing capacity is exhausted.
- **Quantum Emission Opportunity (QEO):** Serialized offload of coherence at collapse.
- **Collapse Propagation Acceptance (CPA):** Radially propagating causal delay zone enforcing re-lock conditions.
- **Tick Pacing:** The substrate-determined minimum interval between causal updates.
- **CI Chaining:** Persistence of quantum systems via re-lock across successive coherence intervals.
- **Entanglement as Tick Synchronization:** Correlation arises from shared pacing, not nonlocal force.

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Implications

The paper outlines testable predictions, including:

- Finite entanglement reach due to tick desynchronization  
- Lower bounds on emission timing intervals  
- Scalar offload signatures in multipartite decoherence  
- Thermal memory effects from incomplete CPA recovery
